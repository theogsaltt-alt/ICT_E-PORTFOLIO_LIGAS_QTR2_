<h1 style="color:#2952a3;">Reflection</h1>
<p style="color:#2952a3;"> 5 Months.</p>
<p style="color:#2952a3;"> 5 months into S.Y. 2025-2026 and there are already so much major events that took place. From the nutri-filled Nutrition month to the diverse AP ASEAN month. Because of the Buwan ng Wika event, I learned to be more grateful and appreciatve of the beautiful culture we Filipinos have. Because of Science month, I leanred that science is not only about facts, it's also the effort we put into investigating the unknown. Because of AP ASEAN month, I learned to be grateful for the diversity in our world, how we as a community are all unique in special ways not only because of our culture, but because of our individuality. Because of Intramurals, I learned how important it is to stay physically fit, and that Intramurals games are all friendly competitions used to test our skill and teamwork. Because of teacher's day, I learned that behind the "Kumuha ng 1/4th!" and "Magpapaquiz ako bukas", teachers are individuals who all strive to bring out the best in students. Overall, I learned that school is not only for academics, but for socialization and growth in many fields. </p>

<p style="color:#2952a3;"> Cultural appreciation, scientific investigation, and sports are all things we need for growth in life. How are we meant to pursue our curiosity without investigating? How are we meant to stay physically fit without the influence of sports? How are we meant to recognize our individuality without cultural appreciation? These things are all fundamental, and I could use all of them to nurture my mind, stay active, and learn the values that shape a good person.</p>

<p style="color:#2952a3;"> Even without all the mandatory activities, I can say I am an active participant of these events. Even as a bystander, I still learn many thinks thanks to my peers and the people who put in an effort to educate us about these lessons. I also cheer for our representatives as they shine in the areas they're best in. If I were to teach a classmate the topics of Buwan ng Wika, I would discuss the intricate history and deep culture of our people. Seeing as Buwan ng Wika is Filipino month, I would also discuss our language and the basic figures of speech. If I were to discuss Science Month, I would first tell them about the importance of hygiene, toothbrushing and handwashing. Additionally, I would also talk about the Scientific Investigation Process. If I were to discuss AP month, I would talk about the diverse culture of ASEAN and POPDEV.</p>

<p style="color:#2952a3;"> For Buwan ng Wika and ASEAN month, it's important to celebrate the diverse culture of not only our country, but the region we are a part of. We learn to appreciate the music, the clothes, the liteature, and the customs that make up our identity. The topics in AP month also help us learn to be aware of the laws and current statistics of different topics. Science month is important to develop our curiosity and encourage us to ask about the unknown. Additionally, this year's Science month encouraged us to be more attentive about our hygiene. Intramurals is important to celebrate sportsmanship and athleticism. Intramurals also encourages us to join different physical activities, helping our bodies stay fit. Finally, Teacher's day is important to acknowledge the efforts of our educators and give them the appreciation they deserve </p>
